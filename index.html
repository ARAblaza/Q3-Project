Most of the danger around cooking appliances boils down to leaving it unattended, but they are especially vulnerable because they are literally built to produce fire, and without proper care, it could easily spread well beyond the kitchen. </p>

								<td>One happy-go-lucky cat is all it takes to turn on the stove while no one is looking. To ensure that stoves don't quietly transform into a house fire, keep kids and animals away. </td>
								<td>If you prefer your clothes without a burning inferno, wear short/tight sleeves or just roll them up so that they don't accidentally hang over the stove burners and catch fire. </td>
								<td>Okay, not technically a cooking appliance but it's an honourable mention nonetheless. Microwaving metal and tinfoil can have explosive and possibly house-burning-down results. Always make sure you didn't leave in your fork and always transfer tinfoil-wrapped food onto a plate. </td>
